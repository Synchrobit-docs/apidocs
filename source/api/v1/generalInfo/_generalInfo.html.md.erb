# General Info

## General API Information

 - The base endpoint is: https://publicapi.synchrobit.io
 - All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.
 - Data is returned in ascending order. Oldest first, newest last.
 - All time and timestamp related fields are in milliseconds.
 - HTTP `4XX` return codes are used for for malformed requests; the issue is on the sender's side.
 - HTTP `429` return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
 - HTTP `418` return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving 429 codes.
 - HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on Synchrobit's side. It is important to **NOT** treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is **UNKNOWN** and could have been a success.
 - Any endpoint can return an ERROR.
 - Specific error codes and messages defined in  Error Codes.
 - For `GET` endpoints, parameters must be sent as a query string.
 - For `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints, the parameters may be sent as `a query string` or in the `request body` with content type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. You may mix parameters between both the query string and request body if you wish to do so.
 - Parameters may be sent in any order.
 - If a parameter sent in both the query string and request body, the query string parameter will be used.



## Endpoint Security Type



 - Each endpoint has a security type that determines the how you will interact with it.
 - API-keys and secret-keys **are case sensitive**.
 - API-keys can be configured to only access certain types of secure endpoints. For example, one API-key could be used for TRADE only, while another API-key can access everything except for TRADE routes.
 - By default, API-keys can access all secure routes.
